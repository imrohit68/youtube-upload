![project-image](https://socialify.git.ci/imrohit68/youtube-upload/image?language=1&owner=1&name=1&stargazers=1&theme=Light)

This Spring Boot backend project focuses on enabling channel owners to manage video uploads through delegated editors utilizing OAuth2 for secure authentication and authorization. The project is designed to facilitate efficient content management on video channels by allowing channel owners to delegate specific upload permissions to authorized editors.

## Enhanced Features Overview

In addition to the existing features like encryption for storing access tokens, JWT for securing endpoints, and role-based authorization, the backend project will be extended to include new functionalities aimed at enhancing video management and approval processes for channel owners. Below are the enhanced features to be implemented:

- **Video Approval Workflow:**
  - *Random Video Preview:* Automatically generate a random 30-second preview of uploaded videos.
  - *Send to Channel Owner:* Notify the channel owner with the generated video preview for approval.
  - *Approval Mechanism:* Allow the channel owner to approve or reject the video based on the preview.

## Project Goals

The enhanced backend project aims to optimize video management on channels by introducing an automated video approval workflow. This workflow will enable channel owners to review video content before publication, ensuring quality control and adherence to channel guidelines. By leveraging existing security features such as encryption and JWT, the project maintains a high level of data integrity and user privacy throughout the approval process.
